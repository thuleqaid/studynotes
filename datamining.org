* Tasks of data mining
  - Classification :: examining the features of a newly presented object and assigning it to one of a *predesigned* set of classes
  - Estimation :: given some input data, estimation comes up with a value for some unknown *continuous* varible
  - Prediction :: the same as classification or estimation, except that the records are classified according to some predicted future behavior or estimated future value
  - Affinity grouping :: determine which things go together
  - Clustering :: segmenting a heterogeneous population into a number of more homogeneous subgroups which are *not predefined*
  - Description and profiling :: describe what is going on
* Methodology
  - 11 steps
    1. Translate the business problem into a data mining problem
    2. Select appropriate data
    3. Get to know the data
    4. Create a model set
    5. Fix problems with the data
    6. Transform data to bring information to the surface
    7. Build models
    8. Asses models
    9. Deploy models
    10. Assess results
    11. Begin again
